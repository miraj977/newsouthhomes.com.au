<strong>What is honeypot anti spam ? </strong>
As of now spam bots are unable to handle javascript and we exploit this point to add an extra fields to your forms using javascript as anti spam checker.

<strong>How our plugin is different than other honeypot anti spam plugins ? </strong>

* Works for most of the forms and wordpress system including registation and comments. So All in one anti spam solution.
* Spam bots can't use javascript so we use javascript to insert honeypot anti spam field in the form and spam bots can't fill it to pass anti spam test. 
* Unique honeypot field name generated for each wordpress installation, so it is hard for spam bots to make one fit for all solution to bypass honeypot anti spam test.

* No API or monthly subscription needed like other plugins. Though we have <a title="WP Armour Extended - Anti Spam" href="https://dineshkarki.com.np/buy-wp-armour-extended">Premium extended version</a> of the plugin, it is not needed to block the spam.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How this plugin is different than other honeypot anti spam plugins ? =

We have used the honeypot technic differently in this plugin to make it work better. What other plugin does is, they add honeypot anti spam field from server side (PHP) and check if the spam bot have filled or not. If it is filled it is marked as spam. But in our case, we add honeypot anti spam field from client side (Javascript) and check if honeypot field exists or not. Spam bots can't use javascript and honeypot field is not available for them. This way we can better trap spam bot.

= Will it block all the spam submission ? =

Spam submission are either created by spam bot or by manual submission from users. Honeypot trap is for spam bots only. So there won't be submission from spam bots. So you get rid of around 98% of spam. And ya, it can block russian spam, chinese spam effectively. 

= Forms i am using is not supported. Can you help ? =

Ya, Please write to us using <a href="https://dineshkarki.com.np/forums/forum/wp-armour-honeypot-anti-spam" target="_blank">support forum</a> and we will try to add anti spam honeypot support to it. 

= How can i verify that honeypot anti spam protection is enabled ? =

Honeypot Anti Spam is a trap for spam bots, so it is not visible for users. However, if you are logged in as Administrator, WP Armour Test widget is shown below the form. This will confirm Honeypot anti spam checker is active in that form. And also allows you to test it as spam bot.

= Do i need Captcha verification ? =

No, with this plugin you don't need Captcha, reCaptcha or Invisble Captcha at all. Lets avoid hassle for common users. Just activate the plugin and for all supported forms, anti spam filter is enabled automatically.

= I am already using reCaptcha but still getting spam. Can this plugin stop spammers ? =

Yes. Spam bots are now able to solve the captcha puzzle. So they are no longer effective as anti spam checker . Our plugin's javascript based anti spam filter can block them as spam bots can't use javascript.

= I see settings to change honeypot anti spam field name. Do i need to change it ? =

By default our plugin generates unqiue honeypot anti spam field name so that the slim chance of spam bots using the field to submit spam is more slimmer. This blocks them to create one for all type solution to bypass the honeypot field. But even in that case if you get spam bot submission, chaging the field name should work.

= Can i see what data spammers are trying to submit ? =

With WP Armour - Honeypot Anti Spam plugin it is No. But if you want you can use <a title="WP Armour Extended - Anti Spam" href="https://dineshkarki.com.np/buy-wp-armour-extended">WP Armour Extended</a> and can see what data spammers are trying to submit. It also have feature to block ip address if there are multiple submission from same IP.
